## TCP Server written in C:
To run the server you would first need to compile it on your system.  

You can compile the server.c file by running `cc -o runserver server.c`.   
After compiling you can run the runserver exececutable file by running `./runserver <port_number>`  
example: `./runserver 1234` would start the server on localhost:1234.
